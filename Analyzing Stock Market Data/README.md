# Analyzing Stock Prices From 2007-2017

This project will demonstrate how to use simple data structures to analyze stock market data provided by Yahoo Finance from 2007-2017. We will answer questions such as:
- Which stocks had the highest and lowest average closing prices?
- Given a date, which stock had the most trades?
- What were the highest trade volume days overall?
- Which stocks were the most profitable during this time period?
