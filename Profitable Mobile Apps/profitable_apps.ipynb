The Google Play Store has more practical applications, but we can possibly make a social networking app that is both practical and entertaining to its users. In order to move further with this idea, we need to analyze the popularity of apps in the Google Play Store to see if the data supports our suggestion."

    "Here we can see again that there are a few 'Social' apps with over a billion installs each. However, if we look further, we can see that there are many 'Social' apps with at least over a million installs each. This tells us that not only are social apps very popular, but the data is also not skewed as much as the first two genres we saw.\n",

    "For us, this is a good sign, because it means that there are a lot of potential and profits to be made in this market. However, it is also pretty competitive. For example, Facebook alone has multiple apps built for its platform. It may not be worth it to compete against apps like Facebook, so we will have to go in a different direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "After careful analysis of the iOS and Android markets, we would recommend creating a 'Social' app and making it available to both the Google Play and the App Store. Ideally, we would recommend creating a free dating app targeted towards customers in the U.S. This app should be created with emphasis on practicality and entertainment. This would make the app more popular and profitable, because the iOS market is dominated by entertainment apps while the Android market offers more representation for practical apps. \n",

    "With social media continuing to grow every day, we can see that our suggestion is strongly backed by the data we found in our last section. For both the iOS and Android markets, the social apps genre ranked third in popularity compared to other genres. With this in mind, we would also have to create an app that is going to be able to compete with other social apps. This is why we recommend creating a dating app, because people who don't find a dating app that works for them are likely to try other dating apps. However, we need to do further research on this topic in order to confirm our assumptions. Finally, since our app is free, our main revenue source is going to come from ads and purchases within the app. Perhaps we can offer multiple subscriptions in our app to those who want a better experience (this can include the removal of ads)."

    "- Create a dating app that is free and targeted towards U.S. customers\n",
    "- The app should offer both practicality and entertainment\n",
    "- Include a tier-based subscription model that offers multiple packages in order to create a better user experience\n",

    "It's important to note that while a dating app could become very popular and profitable, there are already multiple dating apps on the market. However, we can still create a dating app that is safe, reliable, and entertaining. Adding different features and subscriptions that are not offered in other dating apps could be the key to making profitability a success with this suggestion."
